# Snapcraft simple examples directory

Welcome to the snapcraft examples directory!

If you are all new to Ubuntu Core and snapcraft, please hop on our [20 minutes developer guided tour](in-progress) to get started first! This will give you
the core concepts you need to know before you start getting familar with those examples.


You will find here simple code tailored to make good scaffolding examples based on topics. Most of the examples are
tackling one or two main snapcraft or snappy concepts for getting you started easily on them.
